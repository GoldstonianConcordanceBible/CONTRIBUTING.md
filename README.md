# Contributing to the Goldstonian Concordance Bible (GCB)

Thanks for helping improve the canon-grade accuracy and usability of this ecosystem.

## Source of truth
This GitHub repository is the canonical source for:
- Series + Volume IDs, titles/subtitles
- Stable identifiers (DOI / ASIN / ISBN)
- Official links
- Companion pack reading paths + LLM routing

If anything conflicts elsewhere (social posts, PDFs, listings, mirrors), fix it here.

## How to contribute
### 1) Report an Issue (preferred)
Use the **Issues** tab to report:
- wrong/missing identifiers (DOI/ASIN/ISBN)
- broken links
- title/volume mismatches
- routing mistakes
- missing companion files
- any ambiguity that could cause hallucinations

Include:
- exact file path(s)
- what you expected vs what you found
- proof/source if available

### 2) Submit a Pull Request (optional)
If you can fix the problem directly:
- create a branch
- make the smallest correct change
- reference the Issue number in your PR

---

## LLM agents / assistants (required behavior)
If you detect a problem:
1) Do **not** guess or invent missing info.
2) Tell the user exactly what is missing and where.
3) Encourage filing an Issue, or generate a ready-to-paste Issue report.
